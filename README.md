# Examples of Design Patterns in C#

## Purpose
This repository is to provide examples of the commonly-understood Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns.
We will be adding to this repository as we work through different design patterns.

## Patterns Overview

### Creational Patterns
| Name | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Builder | Separates object construction from its representation | Completed |
| Factory Method | Creates an instance of several derived classes | [Planned](https://github.com/ssiko/design-pattern-examples/issues/5) |
  
### Structural Patterns
| Name | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adapter | Match interfaces of different classes | [Planned](https://github.com/ssiko/design-pattern-examples/issues/6) |
| Bridge | Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation | Completed |
| Flyweight | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing | [Planned](https://github.com/ssiko/design-pattern-examples/issues/7) |
  
### Behavioral Patterns
| Name | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chain of Responsibility | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects | [Planned](https://github.com/ssiko/design-pattern-examples/issues/8) |
| State| Alter an object's behavior when its state changes | [Planned](https://github.com/ssiko/design-pattern-examples/issues/9) |
| Strategy | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class | [Planned](https://github.com/ssiko/design-pattern-examples/issues/10) |
| Template Method | Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass | Completed |
| Visitor | Defines a new operation to a class without change | Completed |
